              LetoDMS Installation Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TRANSLATIONS ==============================================

as you can see letoDMS provide a lot of languages but we are not professional 
translators then we wait for users contributions.

If your language is not present in the login panel:
- copy the language/english/ folder and rename it appropriately for your
  language
- open the file languages/your_lang/lang.inc and translate it
- open the help file languages/your_lang/help.htm and translate it too

If you see some wrong or not translated messages:
- open the file languages/your_lang/lang.inc
- search the wrong messages and translate them

if you have some "error getting text":
- search the string in the english file (languages/english/lang.inc)
- copy to your language file (languages/your_lang/lang.inc)
- translate it

If there is no help in your language:
- Copy the English help (english/help.htm) file to your language folder
- translate it

If you apply any changes to the language files please send them to the
letoDMS developers (www.letodms.com).

BEFORE YOU START ===============================================================

letoDMS has changed its installation process with version 3.0.0. This gives
you many more options in how to install letoDMS. First of all, letoDMS was
split into a core package (LetoDMS_Core-<version>.tar.gz) and the web
application itself (letoDMS-<version>.tar.gz). The core is a pear package
which could be installed as one. It is responsible for all the database
operations. The web application contains the gui not knowing anything about
the database layout. Second, one letoDMS installation can be used for
various customer instances by sharing a common source.

Before you proceed you have to decide how to install letoDMS:
1. with multiple instances
2. as a single instance

Both have its pros and cons but as a general rule, try a setup for
multiple instances first, even if your currently only planing for
one instance.

Installation for multiple instances shares the same source by many
instances but requires to create links which is not in any case possible
at your web hoster.

0. Quick installation instructions =============================================

You need a working web server with MySQL/PHP5 support and the files
LetoDMS-<version>.tar.gz and LetoDMS_Core-<version>.tar.gz.

* Unpack all the files in a public web server folder. If you're working on
  a host machine your provider will tell you where to upload the files.

* Unless ADODB is not already installed on your system, download
  (http://adodb.sourceforge.net/) and unpack it in the letDMS 
  directory

* Create a data folder somewhere in your web server. The data folder created
  by the letoDMS archive should work for a test installation and must be
	writable by the web-server user.

For security reason the data folder should not be inside the public folders.
The directory must have read/write permission for the web-server user.

* Create a new database on your web server
  e.g. for mysql:
	create database letodms;
* Create a new user for the database with all permissions on the new database
  e.g. for mysql:
	grant all privileges on letodms.* to letodms@localhost identified by 'secret';
* Execute "create_tables.sql" in the new database

* Edit the conf/conf.Settings.php to match your preference and settings. 
  At least $_rootDir, $_httpRoot, $_contentDir, $_ADOdbPath, $_coreDir,
  $_dbHostname, $_dbDatabase, $_dbUser, $_dbPass must be edited.
  Note that for the path you probably need to ask your provider because
	the absolute path on the server is not immediatly viewable in a hosted
	system.


NOTE: UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION

- make a backup archive of your installation folder
- make a backup archive of your data folder
- dump your current database
- extract the letoDMS archive to your web server
- edit the inc/inc.Settings.php file to match your previuos settings 
  (you can even replace the file with your own one eventualy adding by hand
  the missing new parameters)
- login as administrator
 -execute all the update.php script pointing your browser directly:
  http://www.yoursite/path/to/dms/UPDATE-vX.X.X/update.php

Each update script must be run, starting from the version previous to the
one in the folder name. For example to update from a 1.7.1 to 1.9 you need
to run both UPDATE-v1.8.1/update.php and UPDATE-v1.9/update.php.


1. Requirements ================================================================

letoDMS is a web-based application written in PHP. It uses the MySQL RDBMS to
manage the documents that were uploaded into the application.

Make sure you have PHP 5.0 and MySQL 4 or higher installed. letoDMS
will work with PHP running in CGI-mode as well as running as module under
apache. If you want to give your users the opportunity of uploading passport
photos you have to enable the gd-library (but the rest of letoDMS will
work without gd, too).

You will also need to download and install the ADODB database
abstraction library from http://adodb.sf.net/ unless it is not installed
on your system already.


2. Installation & Configuration ================================================

Unzip the downloaded file (LetoDMS-<version>.zip) in a directory that is
accessible via your web server. Do the same for the file
LetoDMS_Core-<version>.zip. This file may not be unpacked below the
document root of your web server. Since it is a pear package it can
also be installed with 'pear install LetoDMS_Core-<version>.zip'

You will also need to create a directory where the uploaded files
are stored. This directory should not be accessible via your
web-server for security reasons (create it outside of your www-root
directory or put an appropriate .htaccess file in it to prevent direct
access by the web server.).

Download the ADODB package from SourceForge. The URL for the ADODB project
page is:

        http://adodb.sourceforge.net/

Extract the distribution into a suitable directory. For example, one can
extract the files into the LetoDMS root directory.

Now, set up your Database. Use the included script create_tables.sql to
create all tables. Since the exact procedure differs on the
different database-systems I cannot give you a detailed instruction
here. Post any questions concering this problem to the letoDMS-Forum. In
general, create the database, make sure that the database has been selected
(e.g. "USE mydms;"), then run the script. As of 1.6.0, you must make sure
that the database user has "create temporary table" privileges.

N.B. If the create_tables.sql script fails, it may be because the database
has been configured to use InnoDB tables by default instead of MyISAM tables.
If this is the case, it will be necessary to alter the sript such that each
create table command has the text " ENGINE = MyISAM" appended to the end,
immediately prior to the semi-colon. For example:

  Before:

  CREATE TABLE `tblDocumentLocks` (
    `document` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    `userID` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    PRIMARY KEY  (`document`)
  ) ;

  After:

  CREATE TABLE `tblDocumentLocks` (
    `document` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    `userID` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    PRIMARY KEY  (`document`)
  ) ENGINE = MyISAM ;

Now edit the configuration file. First, go to the "conf" directory and copy
(or move) "conf.Settings.php.template" to "conf.Settings.php". Open the file
and set the variables to the correct values (you will find a short description
for each variable in the file itself).

TIP: You can find out your root-directory by placing the following
line into a php-file: <?php phpInfo(); ?>
Open it with your browser and look for "DOCUMENT_ROOT".

When running into problems with the db-settings, read the readme-file
in the adodb-directory or post questions to the letoDMS-Forum.

By default PHP allows only files to be uploaded that are up to 2Mb
in size. You can change this limit by editing php.ini: Search for
"upload_max_filesize" and set it to the appropriate value (you
should also change the value for "post_max_size" and make sure that
your web-server does not limit the size either).


3. Email Notification ==========================================================

A new, re-vamped notification system allows users to receive an email when a
document or folder is changed. This is a new, event-based mechanism that
notifies the user as soon as the change has been made and replaces the
cron mechanism originally developed. Any user that has read access to a
document or folder can subscribe to be notified of changes. Users that
have been assigned as reviewers or approvers for a document are
automatically added to the notification system for that document.

A new page has been created for users to assist with the management of
their notification subscriptions. This can be found in the "My Account"
section under "Notification List".


4. Auto-conversion to HTML =====================================================

Version 1.3.0 introduces a new feature: Documents can automatically be
converted to HTML when uploading.
You can enable this feature by setting $_enableConverting (in 
inc.Settings.php) to true.
You will also need to edit $_convertFileTypes (again in 
inc.Settings.php). This array defines which file-types are converted
and how.
Under windows Word-, Excel- and Powerpoint-Files are automatically
converted using js-Scipts and MS-Office. I tested it with Office 2000
and it worked just fine.
Under Linux mswordview is used to convert Word-Files by default.
Warning: Getting this feature working can be very tricky but if it
works it is a great enhancement I think.
Especially IIS could cause problems with its IIS-Guest-Account not
having enough rights to execute Word or Excel...
You will also have to edit your httpd.conf to be able to view the converted
files online. Load mod_rewrite and add to following lines to your conf:

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$
  RewriteRule (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$ $1op.ViewOnline.php?request=$2:$3 [PT]

IIS Users can download the IIS Rewrite Engine for example:
http://www.qwerksoft.com/products/iisrewrite/

Post any questions to the MyDMS forum, please.


5. Nearly finished =============================================================

Now point your browser to http://your.server.com/mydms/index.php
and login with "admin" both as username and password.
After having logged in you should first choose "My Account" and
change the Administrator's password and email-address.


CONFIGURING MULTIPLE INSTANCES =================================================

Since version 3.0.0, letoDMS can be set up to run several parallel instances
sharing the same source but each instance has its own configuration. This is
quite useful if you intend to host letoDMS for several customers.

1. Unpack the letoDMS distribution ٍ=============================================

Actually there is no need to set up the database at this point but it won't
hurt since you'll need one in the next step anyway. The sources of letoDMS
can be anywhere you like. The do not have to be in you www-root. If you just
have access to your www-root directory, then put them there.

2. Setup the instance ==========================================================

Create a directory in your www-root or use www-root for your instance. In the
second case, you will not be able to create a second instance, because each
instance needs its own directory.

Go into that directory create the following links (<letoDMS-source> is the
directory of your initial letoDMS intallation).

src -> <letoDMS-source>
inc -> src/inc
op -> src/op
out -> src/out
languages -> src/languages
styles -> src/styles
index.php -> src/index.php

ln -s ../letoDMS-<version>
ln -s src/inc inc
ln -s src/op op
ln -s src/out out
ln -s src/languages languages
ln -s src/styles styles
ln -s src/index.php index.php

Create a new directory named conf and copy conf.Settings.php.template from
your letoDMS source into it. Modify it as explained above.

mkdir conf
cp src/conf/conf.Settings.php.template conf/conf.Settings.php

Creating the links as above has the advantage that you can easily switch
to a new version and go back if it is necessary. You could even run various
instances of letoDMS using different versions.

3. Create a database and data store for each instance ==========================

Create a database and data store for each instance and adjust the database
settings in conf/conf.Settings.php aѕ described above.

Point your web browser towards the index.php file in your new instance.
