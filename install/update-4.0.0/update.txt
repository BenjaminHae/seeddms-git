Upgrading to new workflow engine
================================

If you decide to turn on the new workflow mode, then all your current
approvals and reviews will become invisible. They will not be deleted
but there is no way to access them anymore unless you switch back to
traditional mode. You can easily modell the old workflow with the new
workflow engine, but have to set up the transitions, states and actions
yourself. Please make sure there are no documents left with a pending
review or approval.
