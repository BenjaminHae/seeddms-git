Starting with version 3.2.0 of letoDMS ADOdb will not be part of the distribution anymore. Get a copy of it from <a href=\"http://adodb.sourceforge.net/\">http://adodb.sourceforge.net</a> and install it. The path to it can later be set during installation.</p><p>If you like to create the database before you start installation, then just create it manually with your favorite tool, optionally create a database user with access on the database and import one of the database dumps in the configuration directory.
